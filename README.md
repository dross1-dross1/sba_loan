# Small Business Administration Loan Analysis

## Using the dataset given, we were tasked with answering the questions:

  - What factors affect how much the loan is for?
  
  - What factors tend to cause a loan to be defaulted on?
  
  - Build a model to predict which approved loan applications will default on their loan.



## After the analysis, we came to the conclusion that:

  - Term was the most important factor that gives a high prediction model accuracy.
  
  - Non-franchise businesses make higher than the average loan disbursement.
  
  - New Businesses get higher loans.

  - Management and Utilities Industries on average get higher loans.
